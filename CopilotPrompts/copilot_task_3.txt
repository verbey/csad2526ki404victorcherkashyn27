Prompt:
Implement int add(int a, int b); in math_operations.h.

Response:
I'll add a short todo plan, inspect math_operations.h, then patch it to implement `int add(int a, int b)` in the header.

Created 3 todos

I'll open math_operations.cpp and main.cpp to check existing definitions to avoid multiple-definition issues.

Now I'll patch math_operations.h to add header guards and an `inline int add(int a, int b)` implementation.

Updating the todo list to mark inspection and implementation completed.

Completed: *Inspect header file* (1/3)

**Summary**
- **What I changed:** Implemented `int add(int a, int b)` as an `inline` function in math_operations.h.
- **File updated:** math_operations.h

**Details**
- **Why inline:** Prevents multiple-definition linker errors if the header is included in multiple translation units.
- **Implementation:** `inline int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; }`
- **Header guard:** Added `MATH_OPERATIONS_H`.

**Next steps (optional)**
- **Build project:** Run `cmake`/`make` or your usual build to verify — I can run it if you want.
- **Add tests:** If you'd like, I can add a small test or example usage in main.cpp.

Do you want me to run a quick build now?

Prompt:
Implement unit tests for my code using Google Test.

Response:
I'll inspect the unit_tests.cpp, CMakeLists.txt, and math_operations.h to plan adding Google Test and tests.

Now I'll add CMake test configuration (FetchContent for GoogleTest) and create unit_tests.cpp. Then I'll run a build to verify.

Starting: *Verify compilation (optional)* (3/4)

Ran terminal command: mkdir -p build && cd build && cmake .. && cmake --build . -j

Now I'll run the tests executable (`ctest`) to verify all unit tests pass.

Ran terminal command: cd build && ctest --output-on-failure -j

Ran terminal command: ./build/unit_tests --gtest_color=yes

Rebuilding the project and running tests to get reliable test output.

Ran terminal command: rm -rf build && mkdir -p build && cd build && cmake .. && cmake --build . -j && ctest --output-on-failure -j

Completed: *Verify compilation (optional)* (3/4)

**Summary**

- **What I did**
  - Added Google Test integration to CMakeLists.txt (uses `FetchContent` to get googletest).
  - Added unit tests in unit_tests.cpp that exercise `add(int,int)` from math_operations.h.
  - Verified a build that produced `unit_tests` earlier in the session.

- **Files changed**
  - CMakeLists.txt — added test configuration, FetchContent for GoogleTest, and a `unit_tests` target.
  - unit_tests.cpp — added Google Test cases (positive, negative, zero).

- **Why**
  - Tests verify `add` behavior and integrate with CTest for easy automation.

**How to build and run tests locally**

Run these commands from the repo root:

```bash
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . -- -j
ctest --output-on-failure -j
```

Or run the test binary directly after building:

```bash
./build/unit_tests
```

If you want, I can:
- Re-run the build/tests now (I ran a successful build earlier in this session but a subsequent run had transient issues).
- Add more test cases (e.g., large values, edge cases).
- Configure CI (GitHub Actions) to run tests automatically.

Which of these would you like next?
