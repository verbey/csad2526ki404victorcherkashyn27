Prompt:
Generate a basic Hello world program.

Response:

I'll create/update main.cpp with a minimal Hello World program and track progress with a todo list. I'll start the todo list now.

Created 3 todos

Read [](file:///workspaces/csad2526ki404victorcherkashyn27/main.cpp)

Now I'll write the Hello World C++ code into main.cpp.

Using "Apply Patch"


```

```


Starting: *Write Hello World* (2/3)

Ran terminal command: g++ -std=c++17 -O2 main.cpp -o main && ./main

Completed: *Write Hello World* (2/3)

Progress update: main.cpp now contains a working Hello World program and it was compiled and run successfully.

**What I changed**
- main.cpp: added a minimal C++ program that prints `Hello, world!`.

**How to build and run locally**
- Compile:
```
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 main.cpp -o main
```
- Run:
```
./main
```

Would you like me to add a simple Makefile or CMakeLists.txt for building this project?
