Prompt:
Create a GitHub Actions workflow file named ci.yml inside the .github/workflows/ directory.
The workflow should:

Trigger on push or pull request events to any branch that includes "develop" or "master" in its name.

Contain a single job called cross_build.

Use a matrix strategy to run on ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, and macos-latest.

Include the following steps for each OS:

Checkout the repository using actions/checkout@v4.

Install CMake (if it’s not already available).

Run the configuration and build script ci.sh.

Add a Deploy step (it can be a placeholder command for now).
Make sure the workflow is syntactically correct and ready to commit.

Response:
Solution — step-by-step
1. Create a new GitHub Actions workflow file at .github/workflows/ci.yml.
2. Configure triggers for push and pull_request events where the branch name contains "develop" or "master".
3. Add a single job named cross_build that uses a matrix for ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, and macos-latest.
4. For each matrix entry, checkout the repo, install CMake, run the existing ci.sh script (making it executable), and include a placeholder Deploy step.
5. Ensure the workflow is syntactically correct and uses actions/checkout@v4 and lukka/get-cmake@v3 for CMake installation.

### ci.yml

Add a cross-platform CI workflow that triggers on pushes and PRs to branches containing "develop" or "master", runs on Ubuntu/Windows/macOS, installs CMake, runs ci.sh, and includes a placeholder deploy step.
