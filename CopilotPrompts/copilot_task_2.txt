Prompt:
Generate CMakeLists file contents for my main.cpp

Response:
I'll add a short TODO plan, then write a CMakeLists.txt, build the project to verify, and mark the plan complete. I'll start by creating the plan.

Created 3 todos

Now I'll update CMakeLists.txt in the workspace with a minimal, standard CMake configuration.

Using "Apply Patch"


```

```
Quick progress update: CMakeLists.txt created. Next I'll configure and build the project to verify it compiles.

Ran terminal command: cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release && cmake --build build --config Release

Completed: *Add CMakeLists file* (1/3)

**Summary**
- **Changed file:** CMakeLists.txt — added a minimal CMake configuration to build main.cpp as the `hello_world` executable.
- **Build:** Configured and built in build successfully (Release).

**What I changed**
- CMakeLists.txt now contains:
  - `cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.15)`
  - `project(hello_world VERSION 1.0 LANGUAGES CXX)`
  - `set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)` and related flags
  - `add_executable(hello_world main.cpp)`
  - `install(TARGETS hello_world RUNTIME DESTINATION bin)`

**Commands to reproduce**
- Configure and build:
```bash
mkdir -p build
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --config Release
```
- Run the program:
```bash
./build/hello_world
```

Would you like me to:
- add a CMakeLists.txt target for tests,
- switch to a different C++ standard (e.g., C++20), or
- create a `.gitignore` and a small README update mentioning the build steps?
